==================================================
This code has been written as a final peer graded assignment for the Coursera Data Science Specialization: Getting and Cleaning Data Course. 
The code is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset provided by Smartlab.
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


The repository includes the following files
============================================
- 'README.MD'
- 'run_analysis.R': the R code used to create the tidydata dataset provided in tidydata.txt
- 'tidydata.txt': the tidy data dataset optained when running the R complete code provided in run_analysis.R
- 'codebook.MD': the documentation collected from the tidydata dataframe provided in tidydata.txt

Notes on the run_analysis R code
============================
objectives of the code
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The code contains step by step explenations on how these objectives are achieved. 

Final result: written file to directory: Tidydata.txt
